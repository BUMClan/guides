Patching / Additional Software
==============================


PATCHING of Halo is done in the windows file structure 
within the wineskin wrapper (e.g. MyCoolWrapper.app). 
Always do it for both versions of Halo (Customer Edition & 
Combat Evolved)

--> You have to open the wineskin wrapper 
    -> on Mac by right-clicking and chose 

    "Show Package Contents".

    Inside you'll find the windows system file structure.
    
    Halo stuff is here:

    - "<base-dir>/MyCoolWrapper.app/Contents/SharedSupport
       /prefix/drive_c/Program Files (x86)
       /Microsoft Games/Halo Custom Edition"

    and

    - "<base-dir>/MyCoolWrapper.app/Contents/SharedSupport
       /prefix/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Games
       /Halo"


NOTE: Whenever you patch (override one or more files), 
      first backup the old file(s) with a prefix, that 
      way you know what version it was before patching!
