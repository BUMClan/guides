Recommendations:
==================

For macOS with Wineskin, I suggest the latest Chimera-Patch and
therefore not the Chimera-HAC2-Combo-Patch with an older Chimera
version. Why? The Chimera-HAC2-Combo-Patch leads to a jerky image,
no matter what Halo video settings you use. Furthermore, some other
issues occur with that patching (e.g. crashes). But this might be 
different for different systems. You can always create another
Wineskin-Wrapper with a Halo installation that has different
patching! An installation with the latest Chimera-Patch seems
to be very stable.



Possible Patches:
==================

- For example Chimera: https://github.com/SnowyMouse/chimera
  NOTE: "chimera".ini has many many options you want to look at!
  (FPS, default resolution settings, fonts, etc.),
  Latest version (per August 14, 2023) in "99-patches" folder.


- Recommended patch: Environmental sounds with FX:
  DSOAL, see "91-patching-dsound-dll.txt" and files with prefix
  "91-...". Working version in "99-patches" folder.


- If you want Chimera and HAC2 work together, you need a specific
  old chimera version and you cannot install the chimera version
  above nor the latest! You have to use the file
  "chimera+hac2-working-versions.zip" from the "99-patches" folder.
  It is chimera version 600 ("chimera.dll") and a compatible 
  HAC2 version ("loader.dll"). Unlike newer chimera versions,
  both of these DLL-files go into the "controls"-folder in the
  Halo base program folder!


- HAC2 optics pack (compiled by BUM N01): "99-patches/packs.zip"
  This works only if you use HAC2! 
  Packs are unzipped into different locations, depending on if
  you install them for "Combat Evolved" or "Custom Edition"
  (of course, install the packs for both):

  Halo Comabt Evolved: "C:\Users\Your_Username\Documents\My Games\Halo\hac\packs"
  Halo Custom Edition: "C:\Users\Your_Username\Documents\My Games\Halo CE\hac\packs"

  If these folders do not exist, create them! When you have
  unzipped "packs.zip", you should have several numbered
  ZIP-files residing in the "hac/packs"-folders.

  In game if you want to load an optic pack, just type in the 
  console "optic load (pack name)".

  Note: Wineskin on macOS wisely re-routes (per UNIX soft-links)
        The windows user directory to the macOS user directory;
        So at the end, these files are actually stored in your 
        default macOS user file structure stored!
