# HALO Installation Instructions for any macOS (and more...)

These instructions mainly cover installations and 
additional patches for macOS systems with Wineskin 
for Halo Custom Edition and Combat Evolved 
including important Halo patches.

The Halo base installation, the patching and some
configurations described in these instructions work 
for every environment (real, virtual or recreated).

## Notes
- Follow the steps exactly as ordered by the Number-prefixes and really read all text!
- It is essential to start with "01-mac-wineskin.txt". Read and execute all instructions before processing to the next steps.
- You always can update the Wineskin Winery App and even use the latest Wine Windows Engine, which can be downloaded within the App. As of today, the latest engine is "WS11WineCX64Bit22.1.1-10".
- The Wine engines can recreate (it is not an emulation) any Windows version +/- up to date! For Halo you can chose "Windows XP" in the Wine configuration (for the "Default Settings"), but Windows 10 works well too.
- Note, there might be still some unnecessary steps in these instructions, but this is as close I could reproduce a great and working Halo installation. Ideas for improvements welcomed.

## Feedback and suggestions for improvement

## Linux
Wine also runs on Linux, but you will have to use WineHQ (https://www.winehq.org) instead the  Wineskin Winery App for macOS and you have to install Wine too. There is a guide from Cupid available at the "BÛM & GoM friends" discord server, channel "wineskin".
