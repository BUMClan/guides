Software
===============

Software-Package:

- It is assumed that you have all necessary installation files as stated in the "Steps"
  below, which are based on the original Halo Custom Edition CD.



Install
===============

Notes:

- "MyCoolWrapper.app" will be used as a substitution for the wrapper
  you have created with Wineskin; it can have any name!

- Never RUN the game, before everything is installed in this list!
  --> If there is no Exit/Quit-Button, close the installers by clicking the [X]
      in the right-upper corner after installation is done.

- When you get a dialog with a wineskin warning ("No new executables found!") after 
  Any setup/patch installation program, you can ignore this !

- Usually if you run setups and installers and they are finished, Wineskin wants you to
  define a Windows executable (program) that will be executed when you execute the
  Wineskin-Wrapper. But since we are not finished with installation, just press "OK", no 
  matter what is defined in the drop-down-box presented. Nothing will happen nor anything
  will be executed at this time. We define the right executable later (below in "Executables").

Steps:

- Run "Setup.Exe" from "HALO_CE.iso" (from original Halo Custom Edition CD) with "Install Software" function in 
  "Wineskin.app" within your Wineskin-Wrapper, e.g. it is within "MyCoolWrapper.app"
  --> You have to open the wineskin wrapper -> on Mac by right-clicking and chose 
  "Show Package Contents".

- Enter your the Serial-Key when prompted (Format XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX).

- Finish Installation and exit WITHOUT starting game!

- Run "01 Halo Combat Evolved PC Game Patch-1.0.10.exe" (WS: "Install Software")

- Run "02 Halo Custom Edition Update-1.0.10.exe" (WS: "Install Software")

- Again enter the same Serial-Key provided when prompted

- Run "03 Halo Custom Edition Patch-1.0.10.exe" (WS: "Install Software")



Executables
===============

Wineskin Advanced Settings Executables:

- Wineskin executable (for multiplayer - use this one):
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Halo\halo.exe" -novideo -use21

  Notes:
    - "-novideo" removes the annoying intro videos
    - "-use21" is a shader configuration

- Wineskin executable (for single-player & multi-player):
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Halo Custom Edition\haloce.exe" -novideo -use21 -console -devmode

  Notes:
    - "-console" activates the development console
    - "-devmode" activates the development mode


You can use the icon "Titch-Ix-Game-Halo.icns" for your wineskin wrapper.
