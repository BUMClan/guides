1. Some Information About Wine
====================================

You don't have to install anything here, because Wineskin will
takes care of the base software "Wine". But to get a bit more
background information on Wine you can look here if you want:

- See: https://github.com/Gcenx/wine-on-mac



2. Necessary Software
====================================


Quartz X11
-----------
- Download & install package:
  https://www.xquartz.org


Wineskin
-----------

- Read here to get detailed information (optional):
  https://github.com/Gcenx/WineskinServer

- Installation:

  A)  Installation with home-brew package manager,
      in terminal (get it at: https://brew.sh):
         brew install --cask --no-quarantine gcenx/wine/wineskin

  B)  Manual Installation (e.g. if you don't use/have home-brew):
      1. Download: https://github.com/Gcenx/WineskinServer/releases/download/V1.8.4.2/Wineskin.Winery.txz
      2. After downloading remove the flag quarantine before extraction,
         don't extract using the "Keka"-Unpacker, execute in terminal:

           /usr/bin/xattr -drs com.apple.quarantine Wineskin.Winery.txz

  Important: After installation, update to the 
  latest version in the GUI after starting the
  "Wineskin Winery.app".



3. Pre-requisites
====================================

Wineskin needs to be able to execute Quartz X11 on-the-fly. However, 
Apple's System Integrity Protection (SIP) is not allowing this.
Therefore, you have to disable it. Disabling it could be a problem 
for "noob" Mac users solely. To do so:

- See: https://www.r-studio.com/data_recovery_macintosh/System_Integrity_Protection.shtml

If you don't want to disable SIP, and you would like to give Quartz X11 
specifically the permissions it needs, you could follow these
steps (a bit more complicated to achieve):

- See chapter "Full disk access needed":
  https://github.molgen.mpg.de/pages/bs/macOSnotes/mac/mac_x11_apps.html



4. Working with Wineskin
====================================

You have to open the wineskin wrapper you will create in the next steps
(See "02-winery-create-wrapper.png"); you certainly will name it for
example "Halo.app", but in this installation we assume it is called
"MyCoolWrapper.app". Open it later on macOS by right-clicking and chose 
"Show Package Contents". You should see this:

  Folder : /Contents
  Link   : /drive_c
  Link   : /Logs
  App    : Wineskin.app

You'll use the "Wineskin.app" for different tasks to perform, always
use the "Advanced" option in the app. E.g. to go the Wineskin 
configuration utility:

  Wineskin.app 
    --> Advanced 
    --> Tools (Wine Tools Section) 
    --> Config Utility (aka winecfg / Windows configuration).

See: "03-winery-menu-1.png" and "04-winery-menu-2.png".



5. Important
====================================

Always use the "Apply" / "Anwenden" button after you changed 
something in the dialog opened by the Wineskin configuration
utility in

  Wineskin.app 
    --> Advanced 
    --> Tools (Wine Tools Section) 
    --> Config Utility (aka winecfg / Windows configuration).

If any change you made doesn't seem to apply, despite trying
everything, try the following (though this should never be the
case):

  Wineskin.app
    --> Advanced
    --> Tools (Wrapper Tools Section)
    --> Refresh Wrapper
